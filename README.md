# Extra
Ive been curious about messing with FPS for awhile and i want to try different mechanics on this project
the goal is a singleplayer/multiplayer game that is wave based against pve or a pvp gamemode with fast paced movemnent
but im pretty new to some parts of it so itll be a fun experience to say!
